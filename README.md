# Lending-Club-Case-Study

Introduction:
We have been provided the data of a Foreign Financial Institution to study and deduce a conclusion based on observation focusing on the fact to signify Loan Defaulters. Analysing this assignment will give an idea about how profile of applicant is analysed using EDA especially related to Risk assessment in Financial Institutions.
 
Business Concepts:
Lending Club company is one of the largest online loan marketplace, facilitating personal loans, business loans, and financing of medical procedures. Borrowers can easily access lower interest rate loans through a fast online interface.

Working for a consumer finance company which specialises in lending various types of loans to urban customers. When the company receives a loan application, the company has to make a decision for loan approval based on the applicant’s profile. Based on profile one can reach to conclusion as follows:  

A) If the applicant is likely to repay the loan, then not approving the loan results in a loss of business to the company.

B) If the applicant is not likely to repay the loan, i.e. he/she is likely to default, then approving the loan may lead to a financial loss for the company


In this case study, we will use EDA to understand how consumer attributes and loan attributes influence the tendency of default.

When a person applies for a loan, there are two types of decisions that could be taken by the company:

Loan Accepted: If the company approves the loan, there are 3 possible scenarios described below:

Fully paid: Applicant has fully paid the loan (the principal and the interest rate).

Current: Applicant is in the process of paying the instalments, i.e. the tenure of the loan is not yet completed. These candidates are not labelled as 'defaulted'. We will not be focusing on ‘Current Status’applicants as they have 50-50 chances of Defaulting the Loan.  

Charged-off: Applicant has not paid the instalments in due time for a long period of time, i.e. he/she has defaulted on the loan

Loan Rejected:The company had rejected the loan (because the candidate does not meet their requirements etc.). 

Like most other lending companies, lending loans to ‘risky’ applicants is the largest source of called credit loss. In this case, the customers labelled as 'charged-off' are the 'defaulters'.



We are using basic but important concepts of EDA using various tools such as NUMPY, PANDAS, MATPLOTLIB etc.
The entire process is conceptualised into 5 steps as follows:
1)	Data Sourcing & Understanding
2)	Data Cleaning 
3)	Data Manipulation 
4)	Data Analysis (Univariate & Bivariate)
5)	Observation & Conclusion

The sole purpose of this study is based on the fact that the company wants to understand the driving factors behind loan default. The company can utilise this knowledge for its portfolio and risk assessment. Our objective is to simplify the entire process and provide customer with   reliable solution to their business problem.
